The Firebase Realtime Database is a JSON-document database, hosted in the cloud, that is
synchronized to all connected clients with extremely low latency. For more information,
read the https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/[Firebase Realtime Database Introduction].

The Grails Firebase Database plugin provides access to the Firebase realtime database
in your application using simple configuration and an improved API via Groovy closures.
